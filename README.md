# Genome Reserach
This repository is dedicated to research done under Dr. Xijin Ge at South Dakota State Univeristy. We investigate the clustering of different measurements along the human genome.
Our goal is to give biologists easy access to powerful and computationally efficient tools which can streamline their anlyses.

### Ripley's K Function
Ripley's K function is a clustering algorithm commonly employed in spatial statistics. Much effort is put into creating computationally efficient functions to calculate univariate and 
bivariate Ripley's K values in the one dimensional case.
